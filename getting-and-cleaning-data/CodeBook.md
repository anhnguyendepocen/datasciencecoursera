Tidy Data Code Book
========================================================

Study Design
-------------------------
The tidy data was generated by runing run_analysis.R in R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10) -- "Spring Dance" on a 32-Bit Window 7 system.  It averaged 66 variables by subject and activity.

For a complete description of the steps that were undertaken to create the tidy data set I would refer you to the README.md file and the comments found throught the script.  

I would also refer you to the raw data documentation that will be downloaded when run_analysis.R is executed.

### About the Raw Data
The raw data come from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
